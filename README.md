Simple Music Player

This is a simple, responsive web-based music player. It allows you to play a pre-defined list of songs or upload and play your own local audio files.
Features

    Basic Controls: Play, pause, and skip to the previous or next track.

    Progress Bar: Visually track a song's progress and click to seek to a specific point.

    Volume Control: Adjust the playback volume with a slider.

    Local File Support: A button allows you to add one or more local audio files from your device. These files are loaded into the player for a seamless listening experience.

How to Use

    Open the application in your browser.

    The player will automatically load a few sample songs. Use the play, pause, previous, and next buttons to control playback.

    To listen to your own music, click the "Add Local Songs" button.

    Select one or more audio files (e.g., .mp3, .wav) from your computer.

    The player's playlist will be replaced with your selected songs, and playback will begin with the first song you chose.
